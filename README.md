## Features
StockFlow Commerce consists of 2 main roles of account: Distributor and Retailer.

 - Log-in: ability to log in and register through our portal via email, then users will get a confirmation code to be able to choose their role and set up their profile.

 ## Distributors feature 
  - StockFlow Commerce helps users search distributors and products, and efficiently manage stock.
 - Distributor can fully set up their store and start managing their product such as adding product to store and selling them. Distributor can also limit the available products to display on their store. Distributors also have ability to keep retailers informed about the distribution process.
 - Step 1: How to use: Distributor can set up a store by first setting up profile and setting up a store while setting up store they either use to publish the shops and manage their info accordingly
 - Step 2: Now that the store has been set up user can now start listing their products to sell by first create a category and then add products that also include the category and the needed info including quantity. Once products has been sold out instead of adding new products user can import product which is to increase the quantity and start selling it again
 - step 3: Once order has been placed user can now start either accept or reject then update its status accordingly once the products has been deliver user has to get user confirmation from the retailer side to complete order.
